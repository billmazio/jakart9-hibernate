## Jakarta EE 9 and Hibernate Integration Documentation

**Jakarta EE 9** represents the latest evolution of the Java EE platform, emphasizing modern features and enhanced compatibility. In this project, **Jakarta EE 9** is used to build a robust web application.

**Hibernate** is an object-relational mapping (ORM) framework that simplifies the interaction between Java applications and relational databases. It provides a convenient way to manage and persist data in the database using Java objects. In the context of **schoolapp-jsp-mysql-hibernate**, Hibernate has been integrated with the Entity Manager for enhanced data management capabilities. Additionally, **HikariCP** is used for efficient database connection pooling.

### Entity Classes

Entity classes in Hibernate are Java classes that map to database tables. These classes are annotated to define the mapping between Java objects and database columns. Entity classes represent different data entities, such as `Teacher`, `Student`, and more.

### Persistence Configuration

Hibernate's persistence settings are configured in the `persistence.xml` file. This configuration includes details about the data source, entity classes, and other properties required for Hibernate and HikariCP to function properly.

### Entity Manager

The Entity Manager is a high-level API provided by the Java Persistence API (JPA) specification, which is part of Jakarta EE. It acts as a bridge between your application and the database. The Entity Manager handles database operations, such as inserting, updating, deleting, and querying records. Queries can be written using the JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language), which is a SQL-like language tailored for working with entity objects.

### Transactions

Hibernate and Jakarta EE manage transactions to ensure data consistency and integrity. Transactions are essential when performing multiple database operations as a single unit of work. Proper error handling and transaction management are crucial for maintaining data integrity.

# Migrating from schoolapp-jsp-mysql-hibernate Version to jakarta9-hibernate Version 3: Hibernate and Entity Manager Integration

In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of migrating from the second version of **schoolapp-jsp-mysql-hibernate** (for more information about the second version, refer to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/billmazio/schoolapp-jsp-mysql-hibernate.git)) to the enhanced **jakarta9-hibernate** Version 3. The major update in Version 3 is the integration of Hibernate with the Entity Manager and the adoption of Jakarta EE 9, offering improved data management and persistence capabilities.

## Step 1: Understanding the Upgrade

Version 3 of **jakarta9-hibernate** introduces a more sophisticated approach to managing educational seminars. It seamlessly integrates Hibernate, a powerful object-relational mapping (ORM) framework, with the Entity Manager, a core component of Java Persistence API (JPA) from Jakarta EE 9. This integration enhances the application's ability to work with databases and provides a more intuitive and efficient solution for seminar administration.

## Step 2: Preparing for Migration

Before migrating to Version 2, ensure that you have a clear backup of your Version 1 codebase and any associated data. Review the changes and enhancements introduced in Version 2, with a focus on the Hibernate, Jakarta EE 9, and HikariCP integration. Familiarize yourself with the concepts of entity classes, configuration, and database operations using these technologies.

## Step 3: Integrating Hibernate, Jakarta EE 9, and HikariCP

1. **Entity Classes:** Identify the data entities in your application (e.g., Teachers, Students) and create corresponding annotated entity classes. These classes will map to database tables and define the structure of your data.

2. **Persistence Configuration:** Update your `persistence.xml` configuration file to include the necessary settings for Hibernate, Jakarta EE 9, and HikariCP. Configure the data source, entity classes, and other properties as required.

3. **Entity Manager Usage:** In your codebase, replace any direct database interactions with the Entity Manager and Jakarta EE 9 APIs. Utilize the Entity Manager's methods to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on your entities.

4. **Queries and Transactions:** Rewrite any database queries using the Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL). Ensure that transactions are managed properly using Jakarta EE 9's transaction API to maintain data consistency.

## Step 4: Documentation and Deployment

Update your application's documentation to reflect the changes introduced in Version 2. Provide clear instructions on how to work with the new Hibernate, Jakarta EE 9, and HikariCP integration. Once your application has been thoroughly tested and refined, deploy the Version 2 release to your production environment.

## Conclusion

Migrating to **schoolapp-jsp-mysql-hibernate** Version 2 with Hibernate, Jakarta EE 9, and HikariCP integration represents a significant enhancement in data management and persistence capabilities. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can seamlessly transition your application to the new version and take advantage of the benefits offered by these technologies.
